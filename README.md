# pyrcb
`pyrcb` is a simple library for Python IRC bots. It isn't a full implementation
of IRC; instead, it provides just enough to write IRC bots. `pyrcb` is
compatible with Python 2 and 3.

To use it, import `pyrcb` and create a class that inherits `IrcBot`. Override
one or more of the events. (You will most likely want to call `send()` from
within the events.) Create an instance of your class and call `connect()`,
`register()`, optionally `join()`, and `listen()` (or `listen_async()` â€” see
below). See [examples](examples) for examples.

`IrcBot`'s constructor takes one optional parameter, `debug_print`. Setting
this value to `True` will cause all communication with the IRC server to be
printed to standard output.

### Events
`on_join(self, nickname, channel)`  
Called when a user joins a channel.

`on_part(self, nickname, channel)`  
Called when a user leaves a channel.

`on_quit(self, nickname)`  
Called when a user quits.

`on_kick(self, nickname, channel, target, is_self)`  
Called when a user is kicked. `nickname` is the user doing the kicking, while
`target` is the person being kicked. `is_self` specifies whether or not this
bot is the one being kicked.

`on_message(self, message, nickname, target, is_query)`  
Called when a message is received. `target` is to whom/what the bot should
reply. If the message is in a channel, `target` is the channel. If the message
is in a private query, `target` is the other user.

`on_notice(self, message, nickname, target, is_query)`  
The same as `on_message()`, except for notices.

`on_other(self, nickname, command, args)`  
Called when a message not listed above is received. `nickname` is either the
nickname of the user who sent the message or the server name. `command` is the
IRC command or numeric reply. `args` is a list of the message's arguments,
including a trailing argument if present.

### Methods
`connect(hostname, port, use_ssl=False, ca_certs=None)`  
Connects to the specified `hostname` and `port`. `use_ssl` specifies whether or
not an SSL connection should be established. `ca_certs` is an optional path to
a valid [CA certificates file][1], such as [Mozilla's CA certificates in PEM
format][2], from <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html>).

`register(nickname)`  
Sends the IRC server nickname and user information.

`join(channel)`  
Joins the specified channel.

`part(channel)`  
Leaves the specified channel.

`quit()`  
Closes connection to the IRC server.

`send(target, message)`  
Sends `target` the specified message. `target` can be a channel or user.

`send_notice(target, message)`  
The same as `send()`, except for notices.

`send_raw(message)`  
Sends a raw IRC message/command. Useful if you need to send a message not
listed above.

`listen(async_events=True)`  
Listens for incoming messages, calling events when appropriate. This method is
blocking and returns when connection to the IRC server is lost. If
`async_events` is `True`, events will be called on a separate thread and will
not block additional messages from being received.

`listen_async(callback=None, async_events=True)`  
The same as `listen()`, except messages are received on a separate thread. This
method is non-blocking and calls the optional function `callback` when
connecion to the IRC server is lost. The thread started by this method will not
keep the program running, so something else needs to.

`is_alive()`  
Returns whether or not the IRC bot is connected to the IRC server. If you need
infinite loops, use `while bot.is_alive():` instead of `while True:`, so the
loop will stop when connection to the IRC server is lost.
