Tests
=====

To run pyrcb's unit tests, run the file [tests.py](tests.py). The tests should
pass for both Python 2 and 3.

[mock](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock) must be installed to run the tests
with Python 2 (it is included in Python 3's standard library). No additional
dependencies are required.

The file [pyrcb.py](pyrcb.py) should be in this directory. It is symlinked
here, but if the symlink isn't working, you can simply copy the file.
