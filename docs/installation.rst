Installation
============

To use pyrcb, just drop `pyrcb.py`_ (`raw`_) into your project. Make sure you
include a copy of the `LGPL`_ as well as the `GPL`_, since the LGPL is a set of
additional permissions on top of the GPL.

Alternatively, you can include the whole pyrcb repository in your project. You
can still use pyrcb normally (as if pyrcb.py were in your project) with this
configuration; there's no need to import ``pyrcb.pyrcb``.
