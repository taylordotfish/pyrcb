Changelog
=========

.. _changelog-1.13.1:

1.13.1
------

* The ``pop()`` and ``__delitem__()`` methods of `IDefaultDict` are now
  case-insensitive. This caused problems when users with capital letters
  in their names left channels.
* Bots now request the IRCv3 ``multi-prefix`` extension, unless ``send_cap`` in
  :meth:`IRCBot.connect` is false. This allows users who are both voiced and
  channel operators to be tracked properly.

.. _changelog-1.13.0:

1.13.0
------

* Users' voice and channel operator statuses are now properly tracked.
* `IRCBot.nicklist` now maps channel names to `IDefaultDict` instances, where
  each of those dictionaries maps nicknames to `VoiceOpInfo` objects.
* Added `VoiceOpInfo`, a subclass of `IStr` that stores a user's voice and
  channel operator status.
* Renamed `Nickname` to `UserHostInfo`. `Nickname` is now a deprecated alias of
  `UserHostInfo`.
* Added `ISet`, a case-insensitive `set` class.
* Fixed minor documentation errors.
