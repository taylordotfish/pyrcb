Changelog
=========

.. _changelog-1.7.8:

1.7.8
-----

* Fixed uncaught socket errors with :meth:`~IRCBot.listen` and
  :meth:`~IRCBot.quit`.

.. _changelog-1.7.7:

1.7.7
-----

* Fixed an issue where calling :meth:`~IRCBot.quit` would raise an exception.
* Improved socket exception handling.

.. _changelog-1.7.6:

1.7.6
-----

* Errors no longer occur when using ``debug_print`` with a non-Unicode current
  encoding.
* :meth:`~dict.get` and ``key in dict`` are now case-insensitive in
  `IDefaultDict`.

.. _changelog-1.7.5:

1.7.5
-----

* Fixed IStr comparisons with Python 2 (which was causing pyrcb to not work
  with Python 2 at all).

.. _changelog-1.7.4:

1.7.4
-----

* Added ``verify_ssl`` parameter, whether or not to verify the server's SSL/TLS
  certificate and hostname, to :meth:`~IRCBot.connect`.
* :meth:`~IRCBot.connect` now loads the system's CA certificates when
  ``ca_certs`` is not provided. (This does not work on Windows with Python 3.2
  or 3.3.)

.. _changelog-1.7.3:

1.7.3
-----

* `IRCBot` attributes are now initialized when the constructor is called,
  rather than when :meth:`~IRCBot.connect` is called. Attributes are
  re-initialized upon subsequent calls to :meth:`~IRCBot.connect`, so `IRCBot`
  objects are still reusable.

.. _changelog-1.7.2:

1.7.2
-----

* `IDefaultDict` is now a subclass of `~collections.OrderedDict`, so the order
  of keys is remembered. `~collections.defaultdict` functionality is still
  available.

.. _changelog-1.7.1:

1.7.1
-----

* Exceptions no longer occur when comparing an `IStr` object with an object
  which is not an instance of `str`.

.. _changelog-1.7.0:

1.7.0
-----

* Added ``channels`` parameter, a list of channels the user was in, to
  :meth:`~IRCBot.on_quit`. The function signature is now:

  .. method:: IRCBot.on_quit(nickname, message, channels):
     :noindex:

* Fixed an issue where `IRCBot.nicklist` wouldn't update properly.
