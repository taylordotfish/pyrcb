Changelog
=========

.. _changelog-1.14.0:

1.14.0
------

* `VoiceOpInfo` now supports all prefixes, not just "@" and "+".
* Mode tracking is now more accurate and less prone to errors.
* An error no longer occurs when an event handler takes fewer arguments than
  are available.
* Fixed a bug with the ``kill_bot`` parameter in :meth:`IRCBot.start_thread`
  (setting it to ``False`` would have no effect).
