Changelog
=========

.. _changelog-1.12.1:

1.12.1
------

* Fixed an issue where exceptions in background threads would sometimes not be
  printed.

.. _changelog-1.12.0:

1.12.0
------

* Added :meth:`IRCBot.start_thread`, which starts a function on a separate
  thread. This should be used instead of :meth:`~IRCBot.listen_async`.
* Deprecated :meth:`IRCBot.listen_async`. Instead of running the bot in the
  background, start threads with :meth:`~IRCBot.start_thread` and call
  :meth:`~IRCBot.listen` on the main thread.
* Fixed possible errors when closing sockets.
