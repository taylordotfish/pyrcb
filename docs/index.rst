**pyrcb** is a simple, self-contained, extendable library for building IRC
bots. It isn't a full implementation of IRC, but rather provides everything
needed to easily create bots.

pyrcb is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.1 or higher. SSL/TLS support
requires at least Python 2.7.9 or Python 3.2 (see :meth:`~IRCBot.connect`).

The current version of pyrcb is **1.14.2**, which was released on 2016-12-11.
See the :doc:`changelog <release-notes/1.14/changelog>` for more information.

Source code for pyrcb (including this documentation) is available at
`<https://github.com/taylordotfish/pyrcb>`_.
